# acad_plotstyle_manager

Manipulate AutoCAD .stb plotstyle files (a.k.a. pentables) programmatically with Python, to overcome (some of) the limitations of AutoCAD's built-in plotstyle editor interface.

As of 2020/09/07, this is not a ready-to-use Python module, but is still a sandbox for establishing proof-of-concept.
